### Making Ngrok process survive server stop on Linux

It was working OK on Mac OS on the 0.1.0 release, but not on Linux.

It came out that `Process.setsid` should be applied to the spawned process to establish this process as a new session 
and process group leader. This is completely detaching it from the parent process, so it won't be killed when the 
parent will go down.


**Merged pull requests:**

- Add config.hosts example for Rails \>= 6.0.0 [\#18](https://github.com/texpert/ngrok-wrapper/pull/18) ([texpert](https://github.com/texpert))
- Ngrok.start should try to return first @ngrok\_url\_https or then @ngrok\_url [\#17](https://github.com/texpert/ngrok-wrapper/pull/17) ([texpert](https://github.com/texpert))
- Use fork, Process.setsid and spawn instead of just spawn, to change the owner of ngrok process [\#16](https://github.com/texpert/ngrok-wrapper/pull/16) ([texpert](https://github.com/texpert))
